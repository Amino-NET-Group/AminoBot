### How AminoBot handles your data

## AminoBot uses the *Message Intent*, **however**, it will NOT save nor share any messages being sent anywhere, the Intent solely exists for the purpose of adding *Web Device IDs* to the */web-device* command! (This means that the bot only checks messages sent to a **specific server** in a **specific channel**, check more at [The Official GitHub Code](https://github.com/FabioGaming/AminoBot/blob/master/AminoBot/Utils.cs#L61-L102))
### Will AminoBot save any data I send to it in any other way?
- No, AminoBot does **NOT** collect any User data whatsoever, any and all data _(except mentioned above)_ will be processed once and then dumped right after, we do not keep anything.
